# Web-Scraping-API
**Scraped tables from Wikipedia on countries of the world and Africa countries with population. Utilized Python libraries such as BeautifulSoup and requests to extract the data. Also, used API to review from Google Play store and App store for Blocka App and Irorun App. This project helped me to gain knowledge on how to scrape data from various sources and how to extract useful information from it, which was then used for further analysis and decision making.**
